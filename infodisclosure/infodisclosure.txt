Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The insecure code is vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization and validation. The secure version prevents this vulnerability by validating and sanitizing the user-provided username input, ensuring it is a string and removing non-alphanumeric characters.

Tampering violates the integrity property of the CIA triad by allowing unauthorized modification or manipulation of data, compromising its accuracy and reliability.

To enhance security, additional mechanisms can be incorporated, including:

1.Strict input validation and sanitization
2.Parameterized queries or prepared statements
3.Robust authentication and authorization
4.Secure communication using HTTPS
5.Proper error handling and logging
6.Regular security updates for dependencies and server software

By implementing these security measures, the application's overall security posture can be significantly improved, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and protecting sensitive user information.
