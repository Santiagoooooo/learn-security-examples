Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure version of the code is vulnerable to session hijacking and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. 
Session hijacking is possible because the session cookie is accessible to client-side JavaScript, allowing attackers to steal the cookie and gain unauthorized access. 
CSRF attacks can be performed by creating malicious HTML pages that automatically submit forms to the vulnerable server.

Spoofing violates the confidentiality and integrity of the system by allowing attackers to impersonate users and perform unauthorized actions.

The secure version prevents these vulnerabilities by setting httpOnly: true and sameSite: true for the session cookie, restricting client-side JavaScript access and limiting the cookie to same-site requests. 
It also uses a secure secret key for session encryption.

These security measures help protect against session hijacking and CSRF attacks, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user sessions and data.
